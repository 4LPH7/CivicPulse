 People’s Voice – CivicPulse
🧠 Core Objective (Revised)
To build a verified, transparent, and impactful civic-tech platform where citizens raise localized or national issues, others vote on their importance, and government officials receive prioritized, community-backed reports for resolution — weighted by public consensus.

🔒 Authentication & Verification (Trust Layer)
Aadhaar / DigiLocker Integration for real person validation.

Optional facial recognition or biometric validation for critical activities like voting or issue creation.

Geolocation-based address mapping to show only relevant local issues by region (e.g., ward, district).

📢 Main Features
1. Raise a Voice (Issue Reporting)
Title, description, category (e.g., water, roads, health).

Media attachment: images, videos, PDFs.

Auto-tag location from GPS.

Severity rating (self-marked and adjusted via votes).

2. Community Voting
“Importance Votes” based on issue priority (1–5 stars or emojis).

Voting weight can be region-based:

Local issues → Votes weighted by local population.

National issues → Total population ratio.

Threshold-based escalation:

Once 5–10% of local verified citizens vote for a problem, it escalates automatically to respective local authorities.

At 20%+, it's highlighted in the “Hot Zone” for urgent action.

3. Voice Index Score (VIS)
A dynamic score based on:

Number of verified upvotes

Urgency rating

Community engagement (comments, shares)

Time since reported

Helps in prioritizing the issue among others.

🧑‍💼 Government Dashboard
Region-based admin panel for local authorities.

Shows top issues by VIS and trends over time.

Authorities can update status (Under Review, In Progress, Resolved).

Auto-reminders and escalation alerts if no action in X days.

🧩 Additional Features
✅ Voting via Total People Ratio (As you asked)
Every ward/taluk has a known verified population count.

When a problem garners votes from a specific % (e.g., 10%) of the local population, it auto-triggers notification to local reps.

Reaching 25%+ triggers state-level attention.

Reaching 50%+ auto-flags it as a priority issue for national attention.

📊 Issue Trends & Heatmaps
Display regional issue density via maps and infographics.

Time-lapse view to show if issues are increasing or decreasing over time.

📲 Push Notifications & Alerts
For voting calls when an issue arises nearby.

For status updates from officials.

🗳️ Polls & Surveys (Extra Civic Engagement)
Government or NGOs can use platform to run region-specific civic opinion polls.

💬 Optional Anonymous Mode
For sensitive topics like corruption, abuse, etc.

Still requires backend identity verification but hides name from public.

🏆 Gamification and Community Rewards
“Voice Hero” badges for active users.

NGOs or CSR partners can sponsor small incentives for engagement (free data, coupons).
